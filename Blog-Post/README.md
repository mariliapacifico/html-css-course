<h1> Blog Post </h1>

<p> Hi! This blog post was made during the Fundamental Sections of the "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" online course. </p>

<p> We first made the layout with Floats, then we changed it to Flexbox and finally ended with this beautiful post mixing Flexbox and CSS Grid. </p>

<p> (The pages flexbox.html and css-grid.html were used just to practice the concepts). </p>

<h3> Final Result: </h3>
